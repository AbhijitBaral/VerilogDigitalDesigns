# Parity Generator  

A parity generator is a combinational logic circuit that generates a parity bit based on the input data. This parity bit is added to the original data code before transmission to help detect errors during data transmission.
 The parity bit can be either even or odd, depending on the parity scheme used. In an even parity scheme, the parity bit is set so that the total number of 1s in the data, including the parity bit, is even. Conversely, in an odd parity scheme, the parity bit is set so that the total number of 1s is odd.
